    Pushing your Quantified Self data from one place to another.

Simple Node.js app I created to move my Quantified Self data from all their own little silos into one place.

At the moment this is very much focused on Webhook/Firebase as an endpoint for your data, but I'm building it in such a way that it will be easy to add new sources and destinations for your data.

    This is in heavy development at the moment and is not really ready for anyone to use.

If you're wondering about the why and how of this, check out [my site](http://www.greglgomez.me) for which necessitated the creation of this lil' tool.

## License
Haven't set it up yet, but will probably be MIT.

## Contributions

I'm not some code genius, so I welcome any and all input, pull requests, etc.

Of particular use are new connectors, whether as a source or destination.
